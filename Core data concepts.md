The main difference between structured and unstructured data is in their format and organization. Structured data is organized and formatted in a specific way, usually stored in tables with defined fields and types, while unstructured data has no set format and can be in various forms, such as text, audio, video, or images.

Most common file formats:  
CSV (Comma Separated Values) - used for storing tabular data in plain text format,    
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) - used for storing structured data in a human-readable format,  
Parquet - a columnar storage format that is optimized for handling large amounts of data,  
Avro - a data serialization format used for storing data in a compact binary format,  
ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) - a high-performance columnar storage format used for big data processing,  
XML (Extensible Markup Language) - used for storing structured data in a hierarchical format.

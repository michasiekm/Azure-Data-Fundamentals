The main difference between structured and unstructured data is in their format and organization. Structured data is organized and formatted in a specific way, usually stored in tables with defined fields and types, while unstructured data has no set format and can be in various forms, such as text, audio, video, or images.

Most common file formats:  
CSV (Comma Separated Values) - used for storing tabular data in plain text format,    
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) - used for storing structured data in a human-readable format,  
Parquet - a columnar storage format that is optimized for handling large amounts of data,  
Avro - a data serialization format used for storing data in a compact binary format,  
ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) - a high-performance columnar storage format used for big data processing,  
XML (Extensible Markup Language) - used for storing structured data in a hierarchical format.  

Relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in tables with predefined relationships between them. It offers several advantages, including data integrity, scalability, and standardization. They also provide a clear structure for storing data, which makes it easier to query and retrieve information. However,  relational databases can be inflexible when it comes to storing certain types of data, such as unstructured data. They can also be more difficult to scale horizontally than non-relational databases.

Non-relational database, also known as NoSQL database, is a type of database that does not use the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Instead, it uses a more flexible data model and can store data in various formats, including key-value pairs, documents, graphs, and columns. It offers several advantages, including flexibility in data storage, faster performance for certain types of queries, and easier scalability. On the other hand it may lack the data consistency and standardization of relational databases. They can also be more complex to manage and require more specialized knowledge to use effectively.
